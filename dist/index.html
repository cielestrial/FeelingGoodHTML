The surveys are from Dr. David Burns&rsquo; book, &ldquo;Feeling Good.&rdquo; If you like this website please consider buying the book (I will provide a link to it shortly). This website is for personal use and there is no commercial gain (for me, the creator of this website, <span id="warning">cielestrial</span>). <br><br> <span id="warning">**Additional disclaimer**</span> I&rsquo;m not affiliated with Dr. David Burns in any manner besides buying his booking and liking it enough to make this website. <br><br> <span id="warning">Now</span>, with the greatest irony and with it the fullest pleasure, here is a link to the book: <br><br> <a id="book" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0452281326/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="_blank"> &rightarrow; <span id="warning"> The Book </span> &LeftArrow; </a> <br><br> I promise you <strike>(it is not a Rick Roll)</strike> there is more in the book than the two surveys you see on this website. No need to take my word for it; you can buy a copy and see for yourself. <br><br> <span id="warning">P.S.</span> The graphs are not actually included with the book...so yeah... <br><br> <span id="warning">Website Functions:</span> You complete either of the two available surveys.<br> When you hit the submit button, the information is saved on your local machine (everything is completely client-side). There is <span id="warning">ZERO</span> personal information collected by me (or anyone) from the users. <br><br> It is recommended to complete these surveys once a week. You are still allowed to make multiple submissions in the same week, but multiple submissions on the same day will get overridden. Also feel free to leave a comment in the comment box. It can help better characterize what you are feeling at the time of completing the survey, for when you may revisit that submission in the future. <br><br> <span id="warning">(Do it for future you.)</span> <br><br> After each survey, you will be shown a graph of your survey results for the current month. Here you can see the results logged by date, for the current month. As well as, the comments you left on each submission, when you hover over a data point on the graph. <br><br> The <span id="warning">Graphs</span> section shares the same functionality with the added bonus of loading survey files you saved onto your device. If you do not have any saved files, do not worry. Your first submission of every new month will provide you with the option to save the results from the prior month. <br><br> <span id="warning">Lastly</span>, there is a <span id="warning">C</span> at the top right corner. This will generate prompt enabling you to delete the information the website has saved on your browser. <span id="warning"> (This will not delete the files you personally saved onto your device.)</span> <br><br> That&rsquo;s about all the <span id="warning">information</span> you need to utilize this website. <br><br> <span id="warning">Don&rsquo;t worry</span>, if you forget anything, the information will be exactly where you found it the first time. <br><br> ~ cielestrial <br><br> </p> </div> <script type="module" src="/graphs.d9f422cf.js"></script> <script type="module" src="/graphs.61e73785.js"></script> <script type="module" src="/graphs.6d0a5e31.js"></script> <script type="module" src="/graphs.fa61af84.js"></script> <script type="module" src="/graphs.4e82e706.js"></script> <script type="module" src="/graphs.79db84ee.js"></script> <script src="/graphs.9f5beeed.js" type="module"></script> </body></html>
